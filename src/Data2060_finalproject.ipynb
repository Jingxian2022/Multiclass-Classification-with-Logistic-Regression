    "## **Overview of Multiclass Classification with Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiclass classification with logistic regression extends the standard logistic regression approach, which traditionally handles binary classification, to address problems involving more than two classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiclass Classification Basics\n",
    "- Problem Definition  \n",
    "Multiclass classification is the problem of classifying instances into one of three or more classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input and Output \n",
    "  - Inputs $X$ typically come from a feature space.\n",
    "  - Outputs $Y$ are from a finite set of labels $ Y = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\} $, where $ k $ is the number of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiclass Classification Strategies\n",
    "In binary logistic regression, a linear function predicts the probability of the positive class using a logistic (sigmoid) function. Extending this to multiclass classification can be done using the following approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### One-vs-All Approach\n",
    "One-vs-All involves training a single binary classifier for each class, with the samples of that class as positive samples and all other samples as negatives. The class with the highest probability score is selected for each input.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### All-pairs Approach\n",
    "All-pairs involves training $\\binom{k}{2} = k(k - 1)/2$ binary classifiers, each receives the samples of a pair of classes from the original training set, and learn to distinguish these two classes. For prediction, all $k (k − 1) / 2$ classifiers are applied to an unseen sample and the class that got the highest number of \"+1\" predictions gets predicted by the combined classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification, predicting one of two possible outcomes based on input features. It estimates the parameters of a logistic model (the coefficients in the linear or non linear combinations) and transforms the linear combination of features using the sigmoid function, which maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1. Logistic regression belongs to the family of generalized linear models and is widely used when the target variable is binary. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loss Function\n",
    "In logistic regression, the loss function quantifies the error between the predicted probabilities and the actual class labels. The most commonly used loss function for binary logistic regression is logistic loss(sometimes called cross-entropy loss). This function aims to minimize the log loss across all training observations. By penalizing incorrect predictions, the loss function encourages the model to produce probabilities that are closer to the true class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimization\n",
    "Gradient descent and its variants, like stochastic gradient descent (SGD), are common optimization techniques for logistic regression. Gradient descent works by computing the gradient (partial derivatives) of the loss function with respect to each parameter, and updating each parameter in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss."

    "### Previous work introduction\n",
    " - The author demonstrates multinomial logistic regression using Scikit-learn on the Dry Bean Dataset, which is a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The dataset comprises various features of different dry bean types, including Seker, Barbunya, Bombay, Cali, Horoz, Sira, and Dermason.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Beginning by exploring the dataset, the author checks the absence of null values, which simplifies the analysis. He identifies an imbalance in the class distribution and addresses it through random under-sampling to achieve a more balanced dataset. After encoding the categorical 'Class' labels numerically, he examines correlations between features, deciding to remove 'ConvexArea' and 'EquivDiameter' due to their high correlation, to prevent potential overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The data is then split into training and testing sets, with scaling applied to standardize the features. The author trains a multinomial logistic regression model using Scikit-learn's `LogisticRegression` class, specifying the 'multinomial' option for multi-class classification. He evaluates the model's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy score, providing insights into its effectiveness in classifying the different types of dry beans."
